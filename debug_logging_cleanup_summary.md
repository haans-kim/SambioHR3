# Debug Logging Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed DEBUG logging statements from the codebase to clean up excessive logging output.

## Files Modified

### 1. Performance Cache (`src/utils/performance_cache.py`)
- Removed 6 cache hit debug logs
- These were generating the most noise as they fired on every cache access

### 2. Singleton Manager (`src/database/singleton_manager.py`)
- Removed 9 debug logs related to:
  - Singleton instance creation
  - Cache hits/misses
  - Cache overflow events
  - Initialization messages

### 3. Pickle Manager (`src/data_processing/pickle_manager.py`)
- Removed 12 debug logs related to:
  - File loading/saving operations
  - Metadata operations
  - File search patterns
  - Version management

### 4. Individual Analyzer (`src/analysis/individual_analyzer.py`)
- Removed 4 debug logs related to:
  - Analysis start/completion
  - Pickle file not found messages
  - Pattern detection (꼬리물기)

### 5. Database Manager (`src/database/db_manager.py`)
- Removed 4 debug logs related to:
  - Query execution tracking
  - Data type debugging
  - Time object conversions

### 6. Tag System Files
- `tag_mapper.py`: Removed 2 location mapping debug logs
- `rule_integration.py`: Removed 1 rule matching debug log

### 7. HMM Files
- `viterbi.py`: Removed 1 cache hit debug log
- `viterbi_with_rules.py`: Removed 1 cache hit debug log

## Total Changes
- **Total files modified**: 9
- **Total debug statements removed**: 40
- **Primary noise sources eliminated**: Cache hits, file operations, initialization logs

## Remaining Debug Logs
Some debug logs were intentionally kept as they may be useful for debugging:
- Error-related debug logs in exception handlers
- Configuration-related debug logs
- Some analysis-specific debug logs that fire infrequently

## Benefits
1. **Reduced log noise** - Eliminated repetitive cache hit and file operation logs
2. **Cleaner output** - Easier to spot important log messages
3. **Better performance** - Slightly reduced I/O from excessive logging
4. **Maintained functionality** - All code functionality preserved with comments

## Notes
- All removed debug statements were replaced with comments for code clarity
- The debug_log function in `logging_config.py` was kept as it's the utility function
- Some debug logs in UI components were kept as they're less frequent
