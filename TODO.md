# TODO List - Sambio Human Analytics

## Issues to Fix

### 1. GATE Movement Path Issue
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed (2025-07-27)
- **Description**: Fix the GATE movement path detection and handling in the system
- **Details**: 
  - Movement through GATE locations is not being properly tracked
  - Path transitions involving GATE need to be correctly identified
  - May affect employee movement analysis and time calculations
- **Files to check**:
  - `src/analysis/network_analyzer.py` - Movement network analysis
  - `src/data_processing/data_transformer.py` - Data transformation logic
  - `src/analysis/pattern_analyzer.py` - Pattern analysis (if exists)
- **Added**: 2025-07-24
- **Fixed**: 2025-07-27
- **Solution**: Improved get_building_from_location() method in NetworkAnalyzer to handle:
  - SPEED GATE patterns (P4_생산동_SPEED GATE_OUT)
  - 스피드게이트 Korean patterns
  - BRIDGE patterns (P4_BRIDGE → P4_GATE)
  - BP detection priority to avoid P1-BP2 → P2 misclassification
  - Comprehensive test coverage added in tests/test_gate_mapping.py
